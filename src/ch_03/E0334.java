/**
 * *3.34 (Geometry: point on line segment) Programming Exercise 3.32 shows how to test
 * whether a point is on an unbounded line. Revise Programming Exercise 3.32 to
 * test whether a point is on a line segment. Write a program that prompts the user
 * to enter the three points for p0, p1, and p2 and displays whether p2 is on the line
 * segment from p0 to p1.
 * <p>
 * Here are some sample runs:
 * <p>
 * Enter three points for p0, p1, and p2: 1 1 2.5 2.5 1.5 1.5
 * (1.5, 1.5) is on the line segment from (1.0, 1.0) to (2.5, 2.5)
 * Enter three points for p0, p1, and p2: 1 1 2 2 3.5 3.5
 * (3.5, 3.5) is not on the line segment from (1.0, 1.0) to (2.0, 2.0)
