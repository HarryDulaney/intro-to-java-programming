/* **3.9 (Business: check ISBN-10) An ISBN-10 (International Standard Book Number)
consists of 10 digits: d1d2d3d4d5d6d7d8d9d10. The last digit, d10, is a checksum,
which is calculated from the other nine digits using the following formula:
(d1 * 1 + d2 * 2 + d3 * 3 + d4 * 4 + d5 * 5 +
d6 * 6 + d7 * 7 + d8 * 8 + d9 * 9) % 11
If the checksum is 10, the last digit is denoted as X according to the ISBN-10
convention. Write a program that prompts the user to enter the first 9 digits and
displays the 10-digit ISBN (including leading zeros). Your program should read
the input as an integer.
