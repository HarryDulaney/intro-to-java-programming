/**
 * 5.39 (Financial application: find the sales amount) You have just started a sales job
 * in a department store. Your pay consists of a base salary and a commission. The
 * base salary is $5,000. The scheme shown below is used to determine the commission rate.
 * Sales Amount Commission Rate
 * $0.01–$5,000 8 percent
 * $5,000.01–$10,000 10 percent
 * $10,000.01 and above 12 percent
 * Note that this is a graduated rate. The rate for the first $5,000 is at 8%, the next
 * $5000 is at 10%, and the rest is at 12%. If the sales amount is 25,000, the commission is 5,000 * 8% + 5,000 * 10% + 15,000 * 12% = 2,700.
 *
 * Your goal is to earn $30,000 a year. Write a program that finds the minimum sales
 * you have to generate in order to make $30,000.
