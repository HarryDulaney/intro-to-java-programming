 * *8.34 (Geometry: rightmost lowest point) In computational geometry, often you need
to find the rightmost lowest point in a set of points. Write the following method
that returns the rightmost lowest point in a set of points.
public static double[]
getRightmostLowestPoint(double[][] points)
Write a test program that prompts the user to enter the coordinates of six points
and displays the rightmost lowest point. 

Here is a sample run:
Enter 6 points: 1.5 2.5 -3 4.5 5.6 -7 6.5 -7 8 1 10 2.5
The rightmost lowest point is (6.5, -7.0)
