  * 8.29 (Identical arrays) The two-dimensional arrays m1 and m2 are identical if they
have the same contents. Write a method that returns true if m1 and m2 are identical, using the following header:
public static boolean equals(int[][] m1, int[][] m2)
Write a test program that prompts the user to enter two 3 * 3 arrays of integers
and displays whether the two are identical. Here are the sample runs.
Enter list1: 51 25 22 6 1 4 24 54 6
Enter list2: 51 22 25 6 1 4 24 54 6
The two arrays are identical
