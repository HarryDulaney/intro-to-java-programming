/**
 * ***8.20 (Game: connect four) Connect four is a two-player board game in which the
 * players alternately drop colored disks into a seven-column, six-row vertically
 * suspended grid, as shown below.
 * The objective of the game is to connect four same-colored disks in a row, a column, or a diagonal before your opponent can do likewise. The program prompts
 * two players to drop a red or yellow disk alternately. In the preceding figure, the
 * red disk is shown in a dark color and the yellow in a light color. Whenever a disk
 * is dropped, the program redisplays the board on the console and determines the
 * status of the game (win, draw, or continue).
 *
 * Here is a sample run:
 *  * | | | | | | | |
 *  * | | | | | | | |
 *  * | | | | | | | |
 *  * | | | | | | | |
 *  * | | | | | | | |
 *  * | | | | | | | |
 *  * ———————————————
 *  * Drop a red disk at column (0–6): 0
