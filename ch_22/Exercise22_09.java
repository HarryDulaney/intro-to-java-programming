 * **22.9 (Geometry: gift-wrapping algorithm for finding a convex hull) Section 22.10.1
 * introduced the gift-wrapping algorithm for finding a convex hull for a set of
 * points. Assume that the Javaâ€™s coordinate system is used for the points. Implement the algorithm using the following method:
 * // Return the points that form a convex hull
 * public static ArrayList<Point2D> getConvexHull(double[][]s)
 * Point2D is defined in Section 9.6.
 * Write a test program that prompts the user to enter the set size and the points
 * and displays the points that form a convex hull.Here is a sample run:
