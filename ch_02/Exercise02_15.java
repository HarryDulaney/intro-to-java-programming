 * 2.15 (Geometry: distance of two points) Write a program that prompts the user to enter
 * two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) and displays their distance between them.
 * The formula for computing the distance is sqrt[(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)]. Note that
 * you can use Math.pow(a, 0.5) to compute sqrt(a). Sample run:
 * <p>
 * Enter x1 and y1: 1.5 -3.4
 * Enter x2 and y2: 4 5
 * The distance between the two points is 8.764131445842194
