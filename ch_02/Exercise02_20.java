 * 2.20 (Financial application: calculate interest) If you know the balance and the annual
 * percentage interest rate, you can compute the interest on the next monthly payment
 * using the following formula:
 * interest = balance * (annualInterestRate/1200)
 * Write a program that reads the balance and the annual percentage interest rate and
 * displays the interest for the next month.
 * Example:
 * Enter balance and interest rate (e.g., 3 for 3%): 1000 3.5
 * The interest is 2.91667
