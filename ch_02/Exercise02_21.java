 * *2.21(Financial application: calculate future investment value) Write a
 * program that reads in investment amount, annual interest rate, and number of
 * years, and displays the future investment value using the following formula:
 * <p>
 * futureInvestmentValue = investmentAmount * (1 +
 * monthlyInterestRate)^numberOfYears*12
 * <p>
 * For example, if you enter amount 1000, annual interest rate 3.25%, and number
 * of years 1, the future investment value is 1032.98. Here is a sample run:
 * <p>
 * Enter investment amount: 1000.56 Enter annual interest rate in percentage:
 * 4.25 Enter number of years: 1 Accumulated value is $1043.92
