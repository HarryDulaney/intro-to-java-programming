/**
 * 2.17 (Science: wind-chill temperature) How cold is it outside? The temperature alone
 * is not enough to provide the answer. Other factors including wind speed, relative
 * humidity, and sunshine play important roles in determining coldness outside.
 * In 2001, the National Weather Service (NWS) implemented the new wind-chill
 * temperature to measure the coldness using temperature and wind speed. The
 * formula is
 * twc = 35.74 + 0.6215ta - 35.75v0.16 + 0.4275tav0.16
 * where ta is the outside temperature measured in degrees Fahrenheit and v is the
 * speed measured in miles per hour. twc is the wind-chill temperature. The formula
 * cannot be used for wind speeds below 2 mph or temperatures below -58 ºF or
 * above 41ºF.
 * <p>
 * Write a program that prompts the user to enter a temperature between -58 ºF and
 * 41ºF and a wind speed greater than or equal to 2 and displays the wind-chill
