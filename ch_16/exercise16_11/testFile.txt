The jewelry store in Saratoga Springs where the first case was identified -- a man in his 60s -- has been closed since just before Christmas,
it said. Gov. Andrew Cuomo has asked anyone who possibly may have been in contact with that man or even in contact with someone exposed to him to come forward.

The man had not traveled recently, just like the man in the first identified U.S. case in Colorado, which suggests community spread has already happened.
The CDC says the strain had been circulating in the U.K. since September, meaning it likely had been in the U.S. via
travel for some time before it was detected in Colorado.

Cuomo said Wednesday evidence appears to show the confirmed upstate case was connected to UK travel,
despite no recent travel on behalf of the man.
He called once again on the feds to mandate testing for all international travelers.
Hospitals have become increasingly taxed over the last six weeks, a direct consequence of more infections from people's behavior,
Cuomo has said. New York state hospitalizations are at 8,665, the same total admitted on May 6.
Single-day death tolls are at mid-May levels. And weekly case averages are up 37 percent in New York over the past 14 days, according to New York Times data.
